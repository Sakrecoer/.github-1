Dyne welcomes ðŸ¤— all those who come in peace to support this project!

We don't have a code of conduct or a manifesto to adhere and this is on purpose.

> Be excellent to each other.

If chaos erupts from forgetting the above, we will facilitate our way to a more
harmonious and productive environment.

We accept everyone's contributions, without discriminating.
